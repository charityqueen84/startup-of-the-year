<!--To get the text and button in the middle of the image, we need to use Flex
   by using d flex class. look on bootstrap site. We need align-items. But it doesn't
  work. Why not? Inspect - We have the container and then the body.
Everything is in container, and we actually are aligning items in the center, 
because the container is not the full page. It's only the top part. The container
is not fully covering the page. In css, in body, we have height at 100%
We need to tell container that I want you to span the entire height of page.
so we add h-100 (stands for height 100)-->
